To start Webspec's Web editor follow these steps:
  # Checkout trunk
  # You need to have a MySql instance running locally. So please set up one if you don't have it.
  # Setup the DB using a script (otherwise you can copy and paste the SQL):
{{{
cd modules/webspeclanguage-webdiagrameditor/config/schema/
./recreateSchema.sh
}}}
  # From the ROOT directory run (if you are in the previous step run cd ../../../../) :
{{{
mvn clean install -DskipTests
cd modules/webspeclanguage-webdiagrameditor/
mvn jetty:run
}}}
  # The editor will be available in [http://localhost:9090/playground/webspec/index.html]
