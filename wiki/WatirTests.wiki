= Watir Tests =

Watir steps to configure and execute Ruby Watir Test Cases.


== What's needed? ==

Ruby ([http://www.ruby-lang.org/]), it's needed the version 1.8.6 or 1.8.7, the 1.9.x version is not compatible with Watir.

Watir ([http://www.watir.com]), after installing Ruby in the system it's needed to install Watir library, the following code installs Watir:

{{{
gem update --system
gem install watir
}}}

The next step is install the addon for Firefox, the different version for each operating system can be found in the following link: http://watir.com/installation/


== How to execute Ruby scripts ==

The Ruby scripts can be executed with the following sentence:
{{{
ruby script.rb
}}}

The Ruby files must have the .rb extension.


== Extra libraries ==

Watir can be complemented with the Test/Unit library, it allows to have test and suites more organized.
To implement a Test is required to extends the TestCase class, so the code could looks like this:

{{{
require "rubygems"
require "test/unit"

class TC_Example < Test::Unit::TestCase

  def setup
    # setup method
  end

  def testStep
  end

end
}}}

This scripts can be executed in the same way than any Ruby script, e.g.: ruby test.rb
