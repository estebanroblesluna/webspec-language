==1 Maven==
The first time is to setup Maven in your box. 

===1.1 Download=== 
So please download Maven 2 from http://maven.apache.org/. You can use this link which is the latest Maven 2 version today: http://apache.dattatec.com/maven/maven-2/2.2.1/binaries/apache-maven-2.2.1-bin.zip

===1.2 Unzip===
Unzip the zip file and move it to a directory you are going to use. For example, in linux I would move it to /usr/local/maven

==Add path variable== 
Add /usr/local/maven/bin to the PATH variable.

In Linux/Mac you can export do it by running 
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/maven/bin
I recommend to add it to your ~/.bashrc 

In Windows you can do something similar by running from the command line

set PATH=%PATH%;C:\maven\bin

I also recommend you to add it to your user path variables through My computer

==Test==
To test that Maven is working run from the command line:

mvn -version

and you will obtain something like this:

> Apache Maven 2.2.1 (r801777; 2009-08-06 16:16:01-0300)
> Java version: 1.7.0_21
> Java home: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_21.jdk/Contents/Home/jre
