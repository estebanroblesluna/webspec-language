==1 Maven==
The first time is to setup Maven in your box. 

===1.1 Download=== 
So please download Maven 2 from http://maven.apache.org/. You can use this link which is the latest Maven 2 version today: http://apache.dattatec.com/maven/maven-2/2.2.1/binaries/apache-maven-2.2.1-bin.zip

===1.2 Unzip===
Unzip the zip file and move it to a directory you are going to use. For example, in linux I would move it to /usr/local/maven

===1.3 Add path variable=== 
Add /usr/local/maven/bin to the PATH variable.

In Linux/Mac you can export do it by running 
{{{
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/maven/bin
}}}
I recommend to add it to your ~/.bashrc 

In Windows you can do something similar by running from the command line

{{{
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\maven\bin
}}}
I also recommend you to add it to your user path variables through My computer

===1.4 Test===
To test that Maven is working run from the command line:

{{{
mvn -version
}}}
and you will obtain something like this:

{{{
> Apache Maven 2.2.1 (r801777; 2009-08-06 16:16:01-0300)
> Java version: 1.7.0_21
> Java home: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_21.jdk/Contents/Home/jre
}}}

==2. MySql==

===2.1 Download===
Download Mysql 5.5.27 for your OS.

===2.2 Configuration===
Configure a user with name "root" and password "".

===2.3 Schema creation===
If you are in linux you can run the schema creation script that will create the DB for you. The script is located in: /modules/webspeclanguage-webdiagrameditor/config/schema/recreateSchema.sh

If you are in Windows, you can help use creating that script or run the sqls located in /modules/webspeclanguage-webdiagrameditor/config/schema/ in the following order:
* common.sql
* sampleData.sql
* playgroundSchema.sql

===2.4 Test===
Verify that the schema playground has been created
